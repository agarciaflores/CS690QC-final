\section{Motivation}

A satellite-based quantum network offers a practical path to global quantum connectivity. By distributing entangled photons from a satellite to widely separated ground stations, we can overcome the exponential losses that exist in fiber-based channels. Studies of satellite-based quantum networks have shown that link efficiencies via satellite are  $\sim16$ orders of magnitudes greater than direct transmission through optical fibers over a distance of $\sim1200$ km \cite{lu2022}. A satellite-based quantum network minimizes repeater infrastructure, opening the door to secure communications, clock synchronization, and distributed quantum computer between distant nodes. With enough satellites, the dynamic configuration can ensure that any two points on Earth can be entangled on demand.

In this investigation, we explore the possibility of a satellite-based quantum network via an extremely simplified scenario. In the end, we hope to gain some intuition of the dynamics and how they affect the communication. In particular, we consider a varying satellite altitude and ground station separation. Though there are seemingly infinitely many variables here, we hope to gain an understanding of the altitude and separation affect things like fidelity and entanglement of formation.

\section{Problem Setup}

We consider a \textit{source in the middle} quantum network with an Earth satellite and two ground stations. The satellite, with an altitude of $h$, will carry one distribution source and infinitely many Bell pairs. Having only one source, if the satellite is able to simultaneously communicate with both ground stations it will use a furtherst-first protocol so that the success probability is always greatest with the second ground station. The ground stations will serve as receivers and thus all up-link communication will be purely classical. We assume the Bell pairs experience decoherence only when stored in the ground stations. This introduces a useful metric that we refer to as the \textbf{first link age}; i.e., the amount of time it takes the satellite to succesfully link with the second ground having already succesfully linked with the first ground station.

\subsection{Satellite Dynamics}

The problem of a satellite orbitting Earth is a central force one governed by the potential
\begin{equation}
    U = - \frac{\mu m_s}{r}
\end{equation}
where $\mu \equiv G . M_e$ is the product of the universal gravitational constant and the mass of the Earth, $m_s$ is the mass of the satellite, and $r = R_e + h$ is the distance between the center of the Earth and the satellite. This potential gives rise to the traditional gravitational force relation by applying $\vb{F} = -\nabla U$ \cite{curtis2005}.

\subsubsection{Perturbations}

\end{wrapfigure}

When attempting to track a satellite for long periods of time, the oblateness of the Earth cannot be neglected \cite{bate1971}. The effects of the oblateness of the Earth is quantified in the dimensionless quantity $J_2$, the second zonal harmonic. The Earth, with an oblateness of $3.353 \times 10^{-3}$, has a $J_2$ value of $1.083 \times 10^{-3}$ \cite{curtis2005}. To overcome this, we choose an inclincation of zero for the satellite's orbit and enforce an eccentricty of zero. This allows to keep the \textbf{radius of the Earth fixed} at the value of the equatorial radius, $R_e = 6.378 \times 10^6$ m \cite{luzum2011}. When accounting for perturbations we found that the difference in observables is not worth the computational intensity. For example, one can perform a simulation of a satellite with altitude $h$ both non-perturbed and perturbed and compute the difference $\Delta h = h - h_{\text{per}}$ to arrive at Fig. \ref{fig:delta-h}. Fig. \ref{fig:delta-h} reveals that the perturbations have larger impact for lower altitudes. However, \(\Delta h\) (20 km for an initial altitude of 500 km) is negligible when we recall that we consider radii, $r = R_e + h$, and $R_e \gg \Delta h$.\footnote{One may argue that the inclination and drift may also change as a result of the perturbations. However, since symmetry is preserved about the equatorial plane, the inclination remains unaffected. Also, drift was found to be negligible for singular orbits when generating Fig. \ref{fig:delta-h}.}

\subsubsection{Elementary Dynamics}

In the absence of perturbations, we refer back to classical mechanics to find that the equation of motion for the satellite is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eom-sat}
    \theta\qty(t) = \theta^0 + \omega_\theta t,
\end{equation}
where $\theta^0$ is the initial angular displacement of the satellite and $\omega_\theta^2 = \mu.r^{-3}$ is the square of the angular velocity.

When defining a coordinate frame for the Earth it is common practice to define $+\vu{x}$ in the vernal equinox direction and $+\vu{z}$ in the celestial north pole direction \cite{curtis2005}. $+\vu{y}$ is therefore $\frac\pi2$, counterclockwise when looking down at the Earth from the north pole, relative to $+\vu{x}$. We thus take our ground stations to each be $\epsilon$ radians away from $+\vu{y}$: $\phi_{\text{gs1}}^0 = \frac\pi2 - \epsilon$ and $\phi_{\text{gs2}}^0 = \frac\pi2 + \epsilon$.\footnote{By this definition of \(\epsilon\), the orthodromic distance between the ground stations is $d = 2 R_e \epsilon$.} Akin to Eq. (\ref{eq:eom-sat}), the equations of motion for the ground stations are given by \(\phi_{\text{gs}\,i}\qty(t) = \phi_{\text{gs}\,i}^0 + \omega_e t\) where $\omega_e = 7.292 \times 10^{-5}$ rad$.$s$^{-1}$ \cite{luzum2011} is the mean angular velocity of the Earth.

\subsection{Visibility}

Given the equations of motion for the satellite and both ground stations, one can compute the distance between the satellite and ground station $i$ to be
\begin{equation}
    L_i^2 = r^2 + R_e^2 - 2 r R_e \cos(\qty[\theta^0 - \phi^0_{\text{gs}\, i}] + \qty[\omega_\theta - \omega_e] t)
\end{equation}
via the law of cosines. This expression introduces the notion of \textbf{visibility}: when the satellite is able to \textit{see} a ground station and thus able to communicate with it. In order to ensure no visibility exists part the horizon of a ground station, we define communication to be possible only when $L_i^2 \leqslant L_{\text{max}}^2 = r^2 - R_e^2$. We thus define \textbf{simultaneous visibility} as the time when the satellite is able to communicate with both ground stations all at once. An illustration of \colorbox{green!20}{visibility} and \colorbox{green!50}{simultaneous visibility} is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:scheme}, along with an arbitrarily placed satellite. We limit the simulation to having visibility with at least one ground station. Under this restriction, we arrive at the following initial condition for the satellite:
\begin{equation}
    \theta^0 = \pi - \arccos\qty[- \frac1r \qty(R_e \sin(\epsilon) + \cos(\epsilon) \cdot \sqrt{r^{2} - R_e^2})],
\end{equation}
which has the satellite start in gs1's visibility and enter simultaneous visibility as time goes on.

\subsection{Classical Communication}

Qubits and classical information take time to be distributed and processed. We define the processing time to be $\dd{t} \equiv 1 \times 10^{-3}$ s. The amount of time it takes to communcate is therefore distance- and processing-dependent. We define this \textbf{classical communication time} in the following way:
\begin{equation}
    C_c\qty(t_0) = \frac1c L_i\qty(t_0) + 2\dd{t} + \frac1c L_i\qty(t_0 + \frac1c L_i\qty(t_0) + \dd{t}),
\end{equation}
where the first term is the amount of time it takes the initial qubit to received by ground station $i$, the second term is the amount of processing time on both ends, and the last term is the amount of time it takes the ground station to send classical information (success or failure) back up to the satellite.

Qubit loss will be the only form of loss that the communication system experiences. This loss will be due to free-space diffraction, as it is main source of loss in space-based quantum networks \cite{khatri2021}. The loss model we consider is the one defined in \cite{khatri2021}\footnote{\cite{khatri2021} is the direct inspiration for this investigation. It's excellent!}. A thorough definition of the loss model is established in the ancilla file, \texttt{ancilla.pdf}. In short, we consider both free space and atmospheric losses. The free space loss occurs due to large distances and device limitations (e.g., beam broadening) while the atmospheric loss is due to interactions with the atmosphere's particles \cite{khatri2021}.
